# Test Lead Push-On Adapter

Attach a wire to a test lead. For use with alligator clips, Dupont connectors, etc.

#### Updated:

I originally made this to use with flexible stranded wire and it was meant to simply smash the wire between the probe tip and the collet. The sleeve is for strain relief so your wire doesn't break from wiggling around where it goes into the hole. It's not meant to be super robust or to carry much current, just a quick and dirty solution for probing logic on an Arduino project or some such.

The hole now goes all the way through. One side is marked. That side has a groove that may help if you are using this with solid wire instead of stranded or with a bigger gauge wire.

A step file is included for anyone who would like to mod this themselves.
